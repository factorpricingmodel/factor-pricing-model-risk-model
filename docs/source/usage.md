# Usage

## Interactive

The library contains the pipelines to build the risk model. You can
run the pipelines interactively in Jupyter Notebook.

```python
import fpm_risk_model
```

## Pipelines

Factor risk models can be created through the pipelines, while the pipelines
can be leveraged through [prefect-yaml](https://prefect-yaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
